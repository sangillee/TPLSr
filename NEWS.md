# TPLSr 1.0.2

Fixes:
1) Changed the required R version to 3.5 or higher (from 4.0).

# TPLSr 1.0.1

Fixes from CRAN:
1) Changing the title field to title case.
2) Request for CRAN package to be no more than 5MB. Reduced example data size by limiting the number of significant digits to just 3. This changes the result a bit, but should be okay for example demonstration.

# TPLSr 1.0.0

Initial submission to CRAN.
