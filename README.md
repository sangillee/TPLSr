# TPLSr 1.0.3

R Package for using Thresholded Partial Least Squares (TPLS) for big data regression and classification.
It is developed with whole-brain neuroimaging (fMRI) MVPA predictors in mind. TPLS uses analytical calulations
of partial least squares to dramatically speed-up the training of models with large number of features (~millions).
