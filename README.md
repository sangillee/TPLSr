# TPLSr 1.0.0

R Package for using Thresholded Partial Least Squares (TPLS) for big data regression and classification.
It is developed with whole-brain neuroimaging (fMRI) MVPA predictors in mind. TPLS uses analytical calulations
of partial least squares to dramatically speed-up the training of models with large number of features (~millions). 

Please use the package on CRAN as it is the latest stable build.  
Package on GITHUB is a development version that is not released yet.
